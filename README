Some tests with tokenization based on the *Improving the tokenisation of identifier names* paper

steps in the paper:

1. Identifier names are tokenised using separator characters and the internal
capitalisation boundaries.
2. Any token containing the UCLC boundary is tokenised with the support of
an oracle.
3. Any identifier names with tokens containing digits are reviewed and to-
kenised using an oracle and a set of heuristics.
4. Any identifier name composed of a single token is investigated to determine
whether it is a recognised word or a neologism constructed from the simple
addition of known prefixes and suffixes to a recognised word.
5. Any remaining single token identifier names are tokenised by recursive al-
gorithms. Candidate tokenisations are investigated to reduce oversplitting,
before being scored with weight being given to tokens found in the project-
specific vocabulary.
